## Limits

- **macOS only, for now.** Keys live in the macOS Keychain, and `keyfit setup` stops on other systems.
- **zsh and bash.** In another shell, put `~/.config/keyfit/bin` first on PATH yourself (after `~/.superset/bin` if you use Superset).
- **Four tools.** Only `claude`, `codex`, `aws` and `gh` go through Keyfit, when they are found through PATH (typed in a terminal, or run by an agent Keyfit started). These don't go through Keyfit:
  - other commands (terraform, npm, git over SSH)
  - tools called by their full path
  - apps that don't start from your shell, such as IDE extensions and desktop apps

  To run any other command with the project's accounts: `keyfit run -- <command>`.
- **Online checks are cached for 30 minutes.** If a key is revoked within that window, Keyfit notices when the cached result expires, or at once with `keyfit status`. A new AWS SSO or console sign-in, a different Linear key or GitHub token, or a different Claude organization is checked again right away. When a service cannot be reached, a success from the last 24 hours is accepted with a warning; a wrong account never is.
- **One account of each kind per project:** one AWS profile, one Linear workspace, one GitHub login, one Claude login, one Codex login.
- **GitHub means github.com.** GitHub Enterprise hosts are not supported.
- **Claude is checked by organization, Codex by login type.** Codex only has to be a ChatGPT login without an API key. Neither is checked down to the person unless you pin it with `--pin-email` or `--pin-account`. That way, login pools that rotate between accounts keep working.
- **Linear MCP servers are matched by the key variable they read.** Keyfit puts each project's checked key into `LINEAR_API_KEY`, so one Linear server that reads `${LINEAR_API_KEY}` works in every project, always with that project's workspace. Servers that read another variable are hidden unless it is the project's own `env:` variable. To add such a server once:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --scope user --transport http linear https://mcp.linear.app/mcp --header 'Authorization: Bearer ${LINEAR_API_KEY}'
  codex mcp add linear --url https://mcp.linear.app/mcp --bearer-token-env-var LINEAR_API_KEY
  ```

## Turning it off

- **Skip Keyfit once:** `KEYFIT_DISABLE=1 claude` runs that one command without checks, in your unchanged environment.
- **See what would run:** `KEYFIT_DRY_RUN=1 claude` runs the checks in a registered project, then prints the command and the names of the environment variables that would change, and starts nothing. In a folder that isn't registered, and for sign-in commands, the tool runs as usual.
- **Turn it off:** `keyfit setup --remove` deletes the shims and PATH files and takes Keyfit's line out of your shell startup files. Open a new terminal afterwards. Your registry stays, so `keyfit setup --rc` turns everything back on.
- **Delete its data too:** `keyfit setup --remove --purge` also deletes `~/.config/keyfit`: the registry, the check cache and the Claude config folders Keyfit made. It asks first (`--yes` skips the question). Keys Keyfit stored in the Keychain are kept; it lists their names so you can delete them in Keychain Access.
- **Uninstall:** run `pipx uninstall keyfit` or `brew uninstall keyfit`.
